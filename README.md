# News & Weather AI Agent

## Purpose of the Project
This project is an AI-powered web application that serves as an intelligent agent to provide real-time weather updates and the latest news based on user queries. Users can type questions or requests, and the AI decides whether to fetch weather data for a city or news on a specific topic, then returns a natural language summary.

## How Tool/Function Calling is Implemented
The AI agent uses a Google Gemini model to interpret the user's message and determine which external tool (API) to invoke:

- **Tools available:**
  - `getWeather(city)`: Retrieves current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
  - `getNews(topic)`: Fetches recent news articles from the NewsAPI.

The AI model receives a prompt instructing it to return a JSON object specifying which tool to use and the relevant arguments. The backend parses this JSON, calls the corresponding function to fetch live data, then uses the AI model again to generate a natural, friendly summary of the results. This enables dynamic tool usage based on natural language input.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React with Next.js (React server components with client hooks)
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes (Node.js)
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini API via `@google/generative-ai` package
- **External APIs:**
  - [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather data
  - [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) for news articles
- **HTTP Client:** Axios

## Instructions for Running the App

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sigma24/AI-Agent-.git
   cd AI-Agent-

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
   NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key

4. **Run the development server:** 
   ```bash
   npm run dev

5. **Open your browser and visit:**
    ```bash
   http://localhost:3000

6. **Use the app:**
   -Enter your question or request (e.g., "What's the weather in New York?" or "Latest technology news").
   -Click Send to receive AI-generated weather or news summaries.

**System Design**
   -The frontend captures user input and sends it via a POST request to the backend API route /api/agent.
   -The backend sends a prompt with the user's message to the Google Gemini generative model, instructing it to decide which tool to call and with what arguments.
   -The backend parses the AIâ€™s JSON response to determine which API to call:
   -Calls getWeather(city) for weather data.
   -Calls getNews(topic) for news articles.
   -The fetched data is then used to prompt the AI model again to generate a natural, human-friendly summary.
   -Finally, the backend returns this summary to the frontend, which displays it to the user.
